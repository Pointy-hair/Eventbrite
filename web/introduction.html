    <h1>How to use our website</h1>
   <div class="introdution">
    1. Open our website: http://130.56.248.105/</br>
    2. If you didn't login, just login first via Eventbrite</br>
    3. If you don't have the Eventbrite account, just create it.</br>
    4. Choose the event first.(If you don't have any events, then create events on Eventbrite)</br>
    THIS IS IMPORTANT, if you didn't choose any events, all the buttons are disabled.</br>
    5. Start Template Editor, and create your template.</br>
    The template should contains:</br>
    a) "username"</br>
    b) "date"</br>
    These two will be automatically changed to the real attendee' name and the date that this certificate is issued.
       For example:</br>
6. Save the template, click File â†’ Export and choose the SVG format
then click export. (Your template will be saved on the server)</br>
7. After you have the template for this event, you can start using our Mail center.
For example, if you want to send the certificate to selected attendees,
a) first, choose send certificate</br>
b) second, choose selected attendees and select attendees.</br>
c) after filling out all other fileds, click "send" and wait for success.</br>
All done, by now your attendees will receive the email with certificate looks like this:</br>
If someone cannot find their certificate, and ask you to send them one more time. Just do the same thing, but this time you don't need to generate the certificate again.</br>
